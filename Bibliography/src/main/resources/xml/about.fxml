Along with keeping track of the ever increasing number of bibliographical entries, the current version of the program is also dedicated to creating an extensive database of meta-data which in the long run might prove useful to endeavours such as:&#10;&#10;      · Collecting various bibliographic entries that conform to different criteria,&#10;      · Synthesising personal notes, comments and quotes from the bibliographic entries conforming to the desired criteria (e.g. themes, authors, time frame…),&#10;&#10;      · Exchanging files between different parties,&#10;      · Eliminating redundancies in the user libraries.&#10;&#10;The long term goal is to create a framework for comprehensive state of the art analysis and synthesis, to be able to dynamically outline research histories on given themes, or by different people and/or entities, mutually compare them along a timeline, and much more. The current version of bibliography storage and referencing tool, in itself equivalent to available tools like e.g. Mendeley, is the foundation for this future endeavour.&#10;&#10;The important details for users as well as the program development roadmap are presented in the following sections.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Version History and Contributors&#10;&#10;&#10;Version 0.0, April 2020, Sébastien Andreu (dev.), Aleksandar Joksimovic (superv.)&#10;&#10;    - Basic layout of the menu defined, and the main functions are enabled.&#10;    - Most of the implemented functionalities work correctly, but there is more to be finalised, e.g.:&#10;&#10;          o Extraction works properly only when we extract files, but not metadata.&#10;          o File filtering in the “Use library” is not sufficiently robust.&#10;          o Author management in “Add files” has some quirks to be corrected.&#10;          o Other minor quirks that do not impair the use of the program.&#10;          o No document types are implemented yet (e.g. book, conference article) in “Add files”, so technically this version of the program is still useless in practice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Version 1.0, June 2020, Sébastien Andreu (dev.), Aleksandar Joksimović (superv.)&#10;&#10;    - Submenu layouts finalised for a first working version.&#10;&#10;          o All the different types of entries (articles, reports, notes, etc.) and their characteristic meta-data enabled and tested for addition into database.&#10;&#10;          o File filtering robustness verified for the 4 available filters (title, date, document type, theme).&#10;&#10;          o There still exists a minor problem when a dummy file has to be created as a new entry, it creates problems with filtering and extraction afterwards, so care should be exercised when an entry without an input file is created.&#10;&#10;          o Robust exportation enabled for bibliographic files, raw meta-data and meta-data in BibTeX format&#10;&#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" />
